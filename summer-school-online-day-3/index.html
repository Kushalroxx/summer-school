        <p>An Operating System is a System software that manages all the resources of the computing device.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Acts as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware.
          </li>
          <li>Manages the overall resources and operations of the computer. </li>
          <li>Controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes
            application programs and other system software of the computer.</li>
          <li>Examples of Operating Systems are Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, etc.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>As a platform for Application programs: It provides a platform, on top of which, other programs, called
            application programs can run.</li>
          <li>Managing Input-Output unit: It also allows the computer to manage its own resources such as memory,
            monitor, keyboard, printer, etc. Management of these resources is required for effective and fair
            utilization. </li>
          <li>Multitasking: It manages memory and allows multiple programs to run in their own space and even
            communicate with each other through shared memory. </li>
          <li>Manages memory and Files: It manages the computerâ€™s main memory and second storage. Additionally, it
            allows and deallocates memory to all tasks and applications.</li>
          <li>Provides Security: It helps to maintain the system and applications safe through the authorization
            process. Thus, the OS provides security to the system.</li>

            and the computer.</li>
          <li>Networking: The operating system provides networking capabilities such as establishing and managing
            network connections, handling network protocols, and sharing resources such as printers and files over a
            network.</li>
          <li>User Interface: The operating system provides a user interface that enables users to interact with the
            computer system. This can be a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a Command-Line Interface (CLI), or a
            combination of both.</li>
          <li>Backup and Recovery: The operating system provides mechanisms for backing up data and recovering it in
            case of system failures, errors, or disasters.</li>
          <li>Virtualization: The operating system provides virtualization capabilities that allow multiple operating
            systems or applications to run on a single physical machine. This can enable efficient use of resources and
            flexibility in managing workloads.</li>
          <li>Performance Monitoring: The operating system provides tools for monitoring and optimizing system
            performance, including identifying bottlenecks, optimizing resource usage, and analyzing system logs and
            metrics.</li>
          <li>Time-Sharing: The operating system enables multiple users to share a computer system and its resources
            simultaneously by providing time-sharing mechanisms that allocate resources fairly and efficiently.</li>
          <li>System Calls: The operating system provides a set of system calls that enable applications to interact
            with the operating system and access its resources. System calls provide a standardized interface between
            applications and the operating system, enabling portability and compatibility across different hardware and
            software platforms.</li>
          <li>Error-detecting Aids: These contain methods that include the error messages, and other debugging and
            error-detecting methods.

        <h2 id="types-of-operating-systems">Types of Operating Systems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Batch Operating System: A Batch Operating System is a type of operating system that does not interact with
            the computer directly. There is an operator who takes similar jobs having the same requirements and groups
            them into batches.</li>
          <li>Time-sharing Operating System: Time-sharing Operating System is a type of operating system that allows
            many users to share computer resources (maximum utilization of the resources).</li>
          <li>Distributed Operating System: Distributed Operating System is a type of operating system that manages a
            group of different computers and makes appear to be a single computer. These operating systems are designed
            to operate on a network of computers. They allow multiple users to access shared resources and communicate
            with each other over the network. Examples include Microsoft Windows Server and various distributions of
            Linux designed for servers.</li>
          <li>Network Operating System: Network Operating System is a type of operating system that runs on a server and
            provides the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking
            functions.</li>
          <li>Real-time Operating System: Real-time Operating System is a type of operating system that serves a
            real-time system and the time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small. These
            operating systems are designed to respond to events in real time. They are used in applications that require
            quick and deterministic responses, such as embedded systems, industrial control systems, and robotics.</li>
          <li>Multiprocessing Operating System: Multiprocessor Operating Systems are used in operating systems to boost
            the performance of multiple CPUs within a single computer system. Multiple CPUs are linked together so that
            a job can be divided and executed more quickly.</li>
